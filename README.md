## End to End Machine Learning Project with Deployment
# Student Performance Indicator

## Overview
This project analyzes how various factors such as gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation courses influence student test scores. Using a dataset of student performance, we apply machine learning models to predict performance and derive insights.
